# 🍔 Swiggy UI Clone

A **Swiggy-inspired clone** built with **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **REST API integration**.
This project replicates the look and feel of Swiggy’s UI and demonstrates frontend + API-based functionality.

⚠️ **Note:** The project is **not live** because the API is not hosted. Both the **Swiggy Clone (Frontend)** and **Swiggy API (Backend)** need to be used together locally.
